# "Not a Blog” data analysis.

<p> Of all the tags used in all 2612 posts, only three will be analyzed separately: "Writing" and "Dance with dragons" (he used both "A dance with dragons" and "Dance with dragons", but I will consider both as just one) and "The winds of winter". All other tags are classified as "Other tags". 

Note: In publications that have more than one of the aforementioned tags, only one of them is considered, which means the accuracy is approximate, not exact.

In total, the tag “Writing” was the most used: 126 times. “Dance with dragons” was used 77 times and “The winds of Winter” was only used 9 times. This is a chart with very discrepant data, in which the amount added up by the “Other tags” is colossally different from the chart of the other three named tags. However, these highlighted tags are the very ones that will be useful to us in this analysis.

Now, take a look at the book “A dance with dragons”, the fifth novel of the series, which was released in 2011. The posts tagged with “Dance with Dragons” are more common around that time: Of all the 77 times used, 28 were used in 2011, 25 and 2010 and 7 in 2009. Together, they account for more than half of all uses, which makes sense, once "Dance" was about to be released.

Now, the tags “Writing” and “The winds of winter”, when analyzed together, they add up to 17 uses in 2020, 9 in 2021, 5 in 2022, 11 in 2023 and – until now – 7 times in 2024.

But don't be fooled, because the last time he used the tag “The Winds of Winter” was in 2020. And, before that, only in 2015. The tag that inflates the numbers in the graph above is “Writing", which is used more frequently than the other two mentioned in the first paragraph. And the use of certain tags is just a clue. He might use the “Writing” tag and then talk about the writing of another book, like "Fire & Blood", his thoughts on the writing process, or even abou a book written by someone else.

In 2008, 2009 and 2010, he made 605 posts. During that time, he was about to release the book "Dance with Dragons". If we analyze another triennium: 2013, 2014 and 2015, we're going to find out that he posted 608 times, a very close number. And the year 2015 is particularly important, because George himself believed he could finish "The Winds" around that time. This is a potential pattern, as he reportedly used to be very active on the blog in the years leading up to a book release.

If this is true and his posts have been dropping since 2020, could we say he is far away from releasing the next book? I don't know. He released "Fire and Blood" in 2018 and was active in previous years, although very inactive in the year of release. In 2017, one year earlier, the number of posts was almost the double, which kind of reaffirms this potential pattern. However, "The Winds of Winter" is not a normal book, it's THE book. The process to write it is long and irregular. He can write countless pages in one month and zero in the next four months. There may be 500 pages left for him to finish the book or just 50. We don't know. Given that, it's impossible to predict - based on the data we have here - if George is close to finishing or not.
